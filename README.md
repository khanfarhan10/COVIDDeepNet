Code Tutorial and Working Documentation for the proposed model COVIDDeepNet : which will help in COVID-19 Predictions by analyzing Post Anterior Views of Chest X-rays Medical Imaging. Awaiting the responses from [Progress in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.springer.com/journal/13748) ([Springer Nature](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/ai)) for publishing to finally release the code and demos.
