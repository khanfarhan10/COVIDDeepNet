Code Tutorial and Working Documentation for the proposed model COVIDDeepNet : which will help in COVID-19 Predictions by analyzing Post Anterior Views of Chest X-rays Medical Imaging. Awaiting the responses from [EAI GOODTECHS 2021](https://goodtechs.eai-conferences.org/2021/) ([SpringerLink Digital Library](https://link.springer.com/)) for publishing to finally release the code and demos.
